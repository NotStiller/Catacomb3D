Catacomb 3-D: The Descent SDL port
==================================

License
-------

This repository contains the source code for the SDL port of Catacomb 3-D (also 
known as Catacombs 3 or Catacomb 3-D: A New Dimension), Catacomb Abyss 3D and,
later, all the other Catacomb 3D games.

It is released under the GNU GPLv2, please see gpl-2.0.txt for license details.
Also note, that opl.cpp and opl.h were taken from the DOSBox 0.74 sources and
were released under the GNU LGPLv2.1. See lgpl-2.1.txt for license details.

This release does not affect the licensing for the game data files. You will
need to legally acquire the game data (http://www.gog.com/game/catacombs_pack)
in order to use the exe built from this source code.


Compilation and running
-------------------------

The source port should work on all platforms, but frankly, I haven't extensively
tested it yet. If it does not work on your system, please feel free to contact
me.

The game works great with the GOG release:

Known Bugs and Things To Do
---------------------------

- Sometimes ray tracing goes out of map and causes all kinds of shenanigans.
  This was an issue of the original sourcecode, but I will try to fix it, 
  as soon as I got everything else working.

- Get sequels to work.
